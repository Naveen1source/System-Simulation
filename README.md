# System Simulation –  Pizzeria

##  Project Summary

This project develops a discrete-event simulation model of Lion’s Den Pizzeria using ProModel to analyze and optimize:

- Workforce allocation
- Facility layout
- Customer flow for dine-in and take-out services
- Process bottlenecks
- Overall systemhroughput

By experimenting with staffing levels, equipment capacities, and table arrangements, the model identifies the optimal configurations that improve operational efficiency and customer service performance.

This type of simulation and analysis is directly applicable to roles in:

- Operations and Process Improvement
- Industrial Engineering
- Manufacturing Systems Engineering
- Business Analytics / Simulation Modeling
- Supply Chain Optimization
- Workforce Planning and Scheduling

##  Tools

- ProModel simulation software
- Random number generation for arrivals and process times
- Queueing theory concepts
- Statistical analysis for model optimization
